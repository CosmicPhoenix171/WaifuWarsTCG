# Gameplay Overview

Waifu Wars blends fast-paced turns with emotional curveballs. Every duel is a three-round match; win two rounds to claim victory.

## Core Loop

1. **Draw Phase** – Refresh your hand with one card and resolve any start-of-turn triggers.
2. **Main Phase** – Summon waifus (max three on field), cast Support cards, and set Traps.
3. **Battle Phase** – Declare attacks, target opposing waifus, and watch Affection bars melt.
4. **End Phase** – Resolve lingering effects, update Bonds, log bond drama.

### Round Win Conditions

- Lose three waifus (discarded) **or** end your turn with zero waifus on the field and the round is over.
- In a simultaneous knockout, narrative privilege keeps you in the round — you take the win.

### Mulligan Safety Net

If your opening hand contains zero waifu cards, reshuffle and redraw until you see at least one. Nobody wants a duel without their squad.

## Emotional Engine

- **Affection (HP)** – Each waifu card lists its own Affection stat; when it drops to 0 the waifu leaves the field.
- **Bonds** – The relationship meter that powers confessions, meltdowns, and mood transitions.
- **Mood States** – Neutral → Dere → Extreme. Rising bond charge or trigger events (e.g., losing a bonded ally) escalate the mood, unlocking buffs or signature abilities.

### Bond Cards

Support your narrative. Bond cards pair waifus as Lovers, Rivals, or Mentors, unlocking:
- Shared triggers (“When either bonded waifu deals damage, gain +1 Bond point”).
- Combo supers (Confession Phase = free summon, meltdown, or heal).
- Story log entries to chronicle the drama.

## Action Economy

- **Summon Limit:** One waifu per turn unless card effects say otherwise.
- **Support Cast:** Support cards resolve instantly, then head to discard.
- **Trap Tension:** Set face-down cards trigger automatically when conditions are met.
- **Hand Size:** Soft limit of eight — discard down at End Phase if you hoard.

## Combat Snapshot

| Step | Description | UI Feedback |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Declare attack | Choose attacker & target | Card tilt, lens flare |
| Reaction window | Opponent flips relevant Traps | Freeze frame, stinger audio |
| Damage calc | Apply ATK vs Affection, triggers bond & mood checks | Split-screen damage numbers |
| Aftermath | Resolve desperation or Final Stand effects | Cinematic vignette, log entry |

### Affection-Driven Moments

- **Desperation Burst** – Below 2 Affection? Trigger a power spike for one turn.
- **Final Stand** – Prevent discard by spending bond points to cling to 1 Affection and counterattack.
- **Scaling Skills** – Some waifus deal damage equal to 20% of their current Affection or gain ATK as Affection climbs.

## Mobile & Accessibility

- One-column battle field with swipe to toggle opponent view.
- Fan layout hand with horizontal scroll and enlarged tooltips.
- Color-safe palettes and animation toggles for sensitive players.

## Try It Yourself

- Start with the **Starter Tsundere Deck** for a reactive playstyle.
- Dive into **Yangire RNG Rush** if you prefer coin-flip chaos.
- Build your custom deck once you unlock 30+ cards.
