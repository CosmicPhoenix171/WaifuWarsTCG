# Frequently Asked Questions

## When can I play Waifu Wars?
We are prepping a closed alpha with core battle features. Join the waitlist via the landing page to secure an invite once servers spin up.

## Is Waifu Wars free-to-play?
Yes. Core gameplay, deck building, and progression are free. Optional cosmetics and seasonal passes support ongoing development.

## How pay-to-win is the pack system?
Pack odds stay transparent and generous. Duplicates fuel trading rather than power creep, and season balance patches keep decks fair.

## Do archetypes hard-counter each other?
The rock-paper-scissors layer grants small bonuses (think +1 ATK or extra bond charge), not hard locks. Smart deckbuilding and tech cards can flip any matchup.

## Can I play on mobile?
Absolutely. The UI scales for touch, offers animation toggles, and reflows the battlefield into a vertical layout for small screens.

## What about story content?
Confession events, bond logs, and seasonal story drops let you follow your waifus through dramatic arcs. Visual novel interludes are planned post-launch.

## Will there be PvP?
Initial releases focus on PvE and asynchronous challenges. Live PvP is on the roadmap alongside spectator tools once gameplay telemetry is polished.

## How do I submit feedback or waifu ideas?
Email community@waifuwars.gg or ping us on social @WaifuWarsTCG. Community spotlights and design AMA streams happen monthly.
