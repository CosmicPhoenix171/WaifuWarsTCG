# Personality Archetypes

Each dere archetype defines more than stats — it dictates pacing, resource flow, and emotional storytelling.

## Core Dere Lineup

| Archetype | Emotion Driver | Playstyle Snapshot | Sample Signature |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Tsundere | Anger & denial | Late-blooming striker; thrives after taking hits | Gains ATK when damaged or insulted |
| Yandere | Obsessive devotion | Sacrifice HP or allies for lethal spikes | Marks a "beloved" target and deletes threats |
| Deredere | Pure affection | Party-wide buffs, heals, bond generation | Restores bond charge each turn to bonded allies |
| Dandere | Quiet resilience | Slow-playing, defensive, evasive | Opens hidden, gains stats when finally speaking up |
| Kuudere | Calm logic | Counters, negation, control play | Immune to Charm/Fluster; cancels emotional attacks |
| Himedere | Royalty complex | Leader-centric buffs, tribute mechanics | Grants global ATK aura when crowned leader |
| Yangire | Volatile rage | High variance bursts with coin-flip risk | 50% to self-strike or double damage |
| Kamidere | God complex | Command-based field control | Issues orders that redirect opponent actions |

## Emotional State Machine

- **Neutral** – Baseline stats; triggers ready.
- **Dere** – Mid-tier bond thresholds unlock empowered skills.
- **Extreme** – Maxed-out bonds or dramatic triggers unleash final forms with visual overhaul.

Model states per card instance to keep drama deterministic: update bond meters, evaluate mood transitions, then fire abilities in a fixed order.

## Optional Rock-Paper-Scissors Layer

A soft matchup grid keeps metas fresh without forcing auto-loss pairings.

| Macro Family | Includes | Favored Against | Vulnerable To |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Passion Surge** | Tsundere, Yandere, Yangire | Stoic Control | Heart Guard |
| **Stoic Control** | Kuudere, Dandere, Kamidere | Heart Guard | Passion Surge |
| **Heart Guard** | Deredere, Himedere, support-focused hybrids | Passion Surge | Stoic Control |

**Tuning Notes**
- Apply lightweight modifiers (+1 ATK, bonus bond tick) when families clash to keep choice meaningful but fair.
- Use matchup tags on cards (`passion`, `stoic`, `heart`) so hybrid waifus can flex based on deck role.
- Offer tech answers via Support/Trap cards to flip temporary advantage (e.g., nullify Passion Surge bonus for a turn).

## Deck Construction Hooks

- **Faction Passives** – 10+ cards from one dere unlocks daily bond regen or defensive shields.
- **Bond Slots** – Up to three Bond cards per deck sets up relationship combos.
- **Hybrid Builds** – Blend families (e.g., Stoic shell with Passion striker) to counter predictable metas.

## Spotlight: Archetype Combos

- **TsunHealer Wall** – Tsundere frontline with Deredere support to charge Final Stand procs.
- **Royal Mandate Control** – Himedere aura plus Kamidere command traps keeps enemy waifus frozen.
- **YangiFlip Casino** – Yangire volatility buffered by Stoic counters to mitigate self-harm.
