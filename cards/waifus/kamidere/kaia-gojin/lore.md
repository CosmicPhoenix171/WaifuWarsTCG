# Kaia Gojin — Lore

Kaia was born beneath the volcanic vaults of Draconis Prime, a dynasty that crowned its daughters with molten auroras. As the city-states of the mainland clawed for control of her birthright, she chose to walk among mortals, learning how fragile ambition feels when fire is the air you breathe.

Every heartbeat in her presence radiates superheated conviction. She laughs in the face of artillery, scorches entire phalanxes with a flick of her tail, and still finds the grace to compliment a rival’s courage. Kaia fights for the thrill of righteous escalation—where each duel becomes a promise that the world will emerge forged, not shattered.

Her bondmates swear that the blaze in her eyes mirrors the warming tides of her affection. Earn her loyalty and Kaia will melt the armor from your enemies while shielding you from the fallout with wings of incandescent steel.
