# Progression Pillars

Collect cards, climb match tiers, and flex your deck-building chops through a blend of PvE challenges and social trading.

## Currency & Rewards

- **Gems** – Core earnable currency from battles, quests, and events.
- **Daily Quests** – Rotating objectives (win with different archetypes, trigger X bonds) for consistent gem drip.
- **Battle Rewards** – 300–500 gems per victory, scaling with performance multipliers.
- **Seasonal Pass** – Optional track with cosmetics, avatars, and bonus packs.

### Starter Bundle

- 1000 gems
- 20-card protagonist starter deck
- Exclusive animated card back

## Pack Opening Experience

| Pack | Cost | Yield | Vibe |
|------|------|-------|------|
| Basic | 300 gems | 5 cards, Common-heavy | Quick upgrades, friendly to new players |
| Premium | 600 gems | Rare/Epic focus | Build archetype depth fast |
| Ultimate | 1200 gems | Epic/Legendary chase | Showcase pulls with legendary sparkle storm |

- Legendary duplicates stay disabled early on to preserve trading excitement.

## Collection Management

- **Filter Suite** – Type, rarity, archetype, owned vs. missing, mood unlock status.
- **Deck Slots** – Save multiple builds with validity indicators and auto-suggested improvements.
- **Stats** – Track wins/losses, cards collected, trades completed.

## Trading Hub

- Browse live offers with rarity badges, expiration timers, and trust indicators.
- Create offers by selecting 1–3 cards to give, specifying desired cards or rarities, and setting duration (24h/3d/7d).
- Atomic trades: both parties confirm before cards swap; logs keep receipts.
- Anti-scam rules prevent trading away cards slotted in active decks.

## Competitive Ladder

- **Seasons** – Monthly resets with cosmetic rewards and leaderboard badges.
- **Tiers** – Rookie → Prodigy → Idol → Champion → Legendary Boss.
- **Matchmaking** – Archetype-awareness ensures fresh matchups and prevents mirror fatigue.

### Event Types

- **Festival Duels** – Limited-time rulesets (double Bond slots, low-Affection mode).
- **Spotlight Weeks** – Bonus drops for playing featured archetypes.
- **Community Pitches** – Submit waifu concepts; winners become seasonal promo cards.

## Cosmetic Flair

- Animated card backs, profile frames, victory poses.
- Title system: earn epitaphs like "Bond Architect" or "Passion Surge Protagonist".
- Replay sharing with highlight reels and social-ready thumbnails.
