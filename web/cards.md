# Card Types & Rarities

The Waifu Wars arsenal mixes tactical waifus with clutch utility cards. Understanding the lineup helps you sculpt game-winning decks.

## Card Families

| Type | Role | Highlights | Limitations |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Waifu** | Frontline attackers with Affection (HP) and unique archetype abilities | High-impact personalities, emotional states, bond potential | Max three on field; vulnerable to trap blowouts |
| **Support** | One-shot spells that buff, heal, or accelerate | Fast tempo swings, bond generation, card draw | Single-use; timing is everything |
| **Trap** | Reactive surprises that punish or protect | Reverse momentum, punish greedy plays | Must set a turn ahead; telegraphed by field slots |

### Rarity Ladder

- **Common** – Reliable staples for deck consistency. Clean typography, subtle glows.
- **Rare** – Elevated effects and archetype synergies. Blue edges with animated pulse.
- **Epic** – Swingy or deck-defining abilities. Purple border with particle overlays.
- **Legendary** – Signature boss cards. Animated shimmer, holographic foil treatment.

## Signature Tropes

- **Power of Friendship (Support)** – Ally-wide ATK boost when squad goals align.
- **Tsundere Reaction (Trap)** – Convert incoming damage into a retaliatory strike.
- **Yandere Obsession (Waifu ability)** – Mark a target and delete anything that gets too close.
- **Final Form Awakening (Trap)** – Permanent stat boost that cements your protagonist moment.

## Sample Deck Skeletons

## Pack Breakdown

| Pack | Cost (Gems) | Composition | Best For |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Basic | 300 | Common-heavy, chance at Rare | Filling archetype fundamentals |
| Premium | 600 | Rare/Epic mix | Building focused decks quickly |
| Ultimate | 1200 | High Epic, strong Legendary odds | Chasing meta-defining cards and flex pieces |

### Duplicate Policy

Keep every pull — duplicates fuel trading and alternative builds. Legendary duplicates are limited during early seasons to protect rarity value.

## Visual Identity

- Gradient card frames shift with rarity and archetype.
- Stat badges use tabular numerals for quick reads.
- Type icons (Heart, Lightning, Shield) sit in the top-right corner for instant recognition.
